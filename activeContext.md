# Active Context — Saigon18 REopt Integration

## Phase 33 - Vietnam Regulatory Scenario Engine (Phase 2) - 2026-04-29

- [x] Phase 2 - Add mirrored Python and Julia regime-resolution helpers and wire `regime_id` into tariff/export preprocessing
- [x] Phase 2 Validation - Add and pass Layer 2 plus multi-regime Layer 3 parity coverage for baseline, TOU-window, export-cap, and two-part tariff behavior
- [x] Phase 2 Report - Publish a synchronized phase report via the report skill
- [x] Phase 2 Git - Commit the Phase 2 implementation and push the branch
- [x] Review / Results - Record canonical files, validations, report path, and commit

### Review / Results

- Added mirrored `resolve_vietnam_regime` helpers in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/reopt/preprocess.py` and `src/julia/REoptVietnam.jl`, using recursive override merges so named regime bundles resolve onto the base tariff and export-rule payloads instead of branching code paths.
- Extended `build_vietnam_tariff`, `apply_decree57_export`, and `apply_vietnam_defaults` / `apply_vietnam_defaults!` to accept `regime_id`, default safely to `decision_14_2025_current`, and persist `resolved_regime_id`, `regime_registry_version`, and postprocess preview fields into `_meta`.
- Added Phase 2 behavior coverage in `tests/python/reopt/test_unit.py` and `tests/julia/test_unit.jl` for Decision 963 window shifts, draft 50 percent rooftop export caps, Decree 146 two-part trial demand charges, and backward-compatible omission of `regime_id`.
- Extended Layer 3 parity in `tests/cross_language/cross_validate.py` and `tests/julia/export_processed_dict.jl` to compare four explicit regimes end to end: baseline, Decision 963 windows-only, draft 50 percent rooftop export, and Decree 146 two-part tariff trial.
- Published the synchronized phase report at `reports/2026-04-29-vietnam-regime-resolution-phase-2.html`.
- Prepared the Phase 2 implementation as a scoped git change covering only the mirrored resolver logic, unit/parity coverage, the phase report, and the session record, leaving unrelated untracked files untouched.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/reopt/test_unit.py -q` - PASS (`62 passed`, with one expected custom-export warning on the draft 50 percent regime)
- `julia --project --compile=min tests/julia/test_unit.jl` - PASS (`168 / 168`, with the same non-blocking `ArchGDAL` precompile warning already present in the environment)
- `python tests/cross_language/cross_validate.py` - PASS (exact parity across `decision_14_2025_current`, `decision_963_2026_windows_only`, `decree57_rooftop_50pct_draft`, and `decree146_two_part_trial_2026`)

### Next-Step Seeds

- Build Phase 3 deterministic matrix execution so one project input can materialize and run across multiple named regimes and assumption packs.
- Add scenario-hash result storage that always preserves the resolved regime payload and run manifest together.
- Fill the `decision_963_2026_repriced_multipliers` bundle with real multiplier overrides once published data exists, keeping the interface unchanged.

## Phase 32 - Vietnam Regulatory Scenario Engine (Phase 1) - 2026-04-29

- [x] Phase 1 - Add the versioned regime registry file and wire it into the Vietnam data manifest
- [x] Phase 1 Validation - Add and pass Layer 1 and Layer 2 coverage for the new `regimes` data contract in Python and Julia
- [x] Phase 1 Report - Publish a synchronized phase report via the report skill
- [x] Phase 1 Git - Commit the Phase 1 implementation and push the branch
- [x] Review / Results - Record the canonical files, validations, report path, and commit

### Review / Results

- Added the new regime registry at `data/vietnam/vn_regime_registry_2026.json` with five initial bundles: `decision_14_2025_current`, `decision_963_2026_windows_only`, `decision_963_2026_repriced_multipliers`, `decree57_rooftop_50pct_draft`, and `decree146_two_part_trial_2026`.
- Extended the Vietnam data contract in `data/vietnam/manifest.json`, `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/reopt/preprocess.py`, and `src/julia/REoptVietnam.jl` so both Python and Julia `VNData` loaders expose `regimes` as a first-class payload.
- Added Phase 1 validation coverage in `tests/python/reopt/test_data_validation.py`, `tests/julia/test_data_validation.jl`, `tests/python/reopt/test_unit.py`, and `tests/julia/test_unit.jl` to enforce the new manifest key, registry schema, and loader surface.
- Published the synchronized phase report at `reports/2026-04-29-vietnam-regime-registry-phase-1.html`.
- Prepared the Phase 1 implementation as a self-contained git change that stages only the new registry, loader/test updates, the phase report, and the session record, leaving unrelated untracked files untouched.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/reopt/test_data_validation.py tests/python/reopt/test_unit.py -q` - PASS (`89 passed`)
- `julia --project --compile=min tests/julia/test_data_validation.jl` - PASS (`268 / 268`)
- `julia --project --compile=min tests/julia/test_unit.jl` - PASS (`151 / 151` with non-blocking `ArchGDAL` precompile warnings emitted in the environment)

### Next-Step Seeds

- Add Phase 2 regime-resolution helpers so `regime_id` can actually drive tariff and export-rule behavior.
- Keep the default branch of behavior tied to `decision_14_2025_current` to avoid breaking existing scenario builders.
- Extend the cross-language parity fixture once regime resolution exists so multiple named bundles are compared end to end.

## Phase 31 - DPPA Case 1-3 Retrospective Review - 2026-04-23

- [x] Review the canonical plans, implementation modules, tests, artifacts, and reports for DPPA Cases 1, 2, and 3
- [x] Compare each case's documented intent against the delivered implementation and evidence
- [x] Identify shortcomings, improvement opportunities, and reusable lessons across the three-case progression
- [x] Publish a detailed markdown report under `reports/`
- [x] Review / Results - Record the report path and the highest-priority follow-up themes

### Review / Results

- Published the consolidated retrospective review at `reports/2026-04-23-dppa-case-1-3-retrospective-review.md`, covering plans, implementation, tests, artifacts, reports, and the buyer-guide basis across Cases 1-3.
- Main judgment: Case 1 is a useful private-wire reference but did not actually validate a PV+BESS candidate, Case 2 is the strongest and most reusable synthetic-DPPA workflow currently in the repo, and Case 3 has the strongest realism-first framing but is not yet decision-grade because downstream Phases D-G remain partial or defective.
- Highest-priority repo follow-up: preserve Case 2 as the canonical settlement architecture, repair Case 3 by reusing that hourly settlement engine more faithfully, and avoid publishing final closeout reports until artifact contracts and downstream analytics are validated as strongly as the A/B planning surfaces.
- Biggest documentation takeaway: the repo's DPPA case family is under-documented at the top level because `README.md` and `docs/` do not currently explain the role, status, and canonical outputs of Cases 1-3; critical truths are still concentrated in `activeContext.md` and review reports.

## Phase 30 - DPPA Case 3 Plan-vs-Implementation Review - 2026-04-21

- [x] Read the canonical Case 3 markdown plan and repo workflow files
- [x] Inspect implemented Case 3 scripts, scenarios, artifacts, and available tests across phases A-G
- [x] Compare promised deliverables versus delivered surfaces to identify alignments, deviations, and likely defects
- [x] Publish a markdown review report under `reports/`
- [x] Review / Results - Record the most important strengths, gaps, and follow-up priorities

### Review / Results

- Published the implementation audit at `reports/2026-04-21-dppa-case-3-plan-implementation-review.md` after comparing the canonical plan to the delivered Case 3 code, scenarios, artifacts, tests, and final HTML report.
- Strongest alignments: Phase A/B definition work is solid, the site-consistency block is genuinely implemented, and the bounded-opt physical lane does enforce nonzero storage so Case 3 does not collapse back to PV-only.
- Biggest deviations: the strike sweep was planned but not executed, the 22kV two-part branch is only partially real, side-by-side tariff delta reporting was promised but not actually delivered, and no Phase C-F regression test suite was found.
- Most important defects called out in the review: Phase E controller math is numerically broken, Phase E compares different physical candidates instead of the same candidate under two dispatch modes, Phase F writes null NPV into the screening decision despite negative PySAM NPV being available, and Phase G aggregates flat artifacts as if they were nested, which zeroes key benchmark/risk/physical values and contaminates the final HTML report.
- Final review judgment: the current Case 3 implementation is directionally useful and plausibly points toward `reject_current_case`, but it is not yet fully faithful to the original markdown plan or reliable enough to treat as a final decision-grade workflow without fixing Phases D-G and adding the missing test coverage.

## Phase 26 - DPPA Case 2 Implementation (Phases C-D) - 2026-04-14

- [x] Phase C - Add the canonical DPPA Case 2 REopt scenario builder and physical-summary surfaces
- [x] Phase C Validation - Prove the scenario contract with failing-then-passing regression coverage and targeted execution
- [x] Phase D - Implement the buyer-side settlement engine and benchmark comparison artifacts
- [x] Phase D Validation - Prove matched, shortfall, excess, CfD, and benchmark math with failing-then-passing regression coverage and targeted execution
- [x] Reporting - Publish synchronized HTML reports for Phase C and Phase D via the report-skill template flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record canonical files, validations, artifacts, and next-step seeds

### Review / Results

- Implemented the canonical Phase C/D helper surfaces in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/dppa_case_2.py`, including the Case 2 scenario builder, market proxy, settlement input builder, physical summary, buyer settlement ledger, and buyer benchmark artifact.
- Corrected the Case 2 scenario contract so `ElectricTariff` remains present with the valid REopt `tou_energy_rates_per_kwh` field while stripping the invalid `tou_energy_rates_vnd_per_kwh` field that had broken Julia `Scenario()` construction.
- Published the solved Case 2 scenario and result surfaces at `scenarios/case_studies/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2.json` and `artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_reopt-results.json`.
- Published the canonical Phase C/D machine-readable artifacts at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_physical-summary.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_buyer-settlement.json`, and `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_buyer-benchmark.json`.
- Generated synchronized HTML reports at `reports/2026-04-14-dppa-case-2-phase-c.html` and `reports/2026-04-14-dppa-case-2-phase-d.html`.
- Real solved outcome for the current proxy-priced base case: REopt selected about `41.725 MW` PV with no storage, matched about `28.16%` of annual load, and the buyer benchmark shows a premium of about `12.03B VND` versus EVN with blended buyer cost about `2084.13 VND/kWh` versus benchmark about `2018.88 VND/kWh`.

### Validation

- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_cd.py -q` - PASS (`5 passed`)
- `python scripts/python/integration/build_ninhsim_reopt_input.py --scenarios dppa_case_2` - PASS
- `julia --project --compile=min scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl --scenario scenarios/case_studies/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2.json --no-solve` - PASS
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/run_ninhsim_dppa_case_2.py` - PASS
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_cd_reports.py` - PASS

### Next-Step Seeds

- Replace the proxy market-reference series with a trusted hourly CFMP/FMP source so the buyer benchmark can move from directional to bankable.
- Run Phase E sensitivities on strike, DPPA adder, KPP, and excess-generation treatment now that the base Phase D ledger is frozen and executable.
- Feed the buyer settlement outputs into a future PySAM developer-side pass without collapsing the ledger back into one blended strike-only revenue assumption.

## Phase 27 - DPPA Case 2 Implementation (Phase E) - 2026-04-15

- [x] Phase 1 - Read the current DPPA Case 2 implementation, tests, artifacts, and report patterns relevant to Phase E sensitivities
- [x] Phase 2 - Add failing regression coverage for strike, DPPA adder, KPP, and excess-treatment sensitivity outputs
- [x] Phase 3 - Implement the Phase E sensitivity engine and publish machine-readable artifacts
- [x] Phase 4 - Run targeted validation commands and regenerate the canonical Phase E artifacts
- [x] Phase 5 - Publish a synchronized HTML Phase E report via the report skill flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record canonical files, validations, artifacts, and next-step seeds

### Notes

- Phase E should build on the frozen Phase D buyer settlement ledger rather than re-deriving new commercial field names.
- Sensitivities should stay explicit and auditable: strike, DPPA adder, KPP, and excess-generation treatment must be visible in the artifact inputs and outputs.
- Reporting should follow the repo's explicit-height Chart.js pattern so the HTML output remains browser-safe.

### Review / Results

- Implemented Phase E sensitivity surfaces in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/dppa_case_2.py`, adding the strike negotiation screen, contract-risk sensitivity engine, and helper logic that reuses the frozen Phase D settlement ledger instead of inventing a parallel model.
- Added the Case 2 PySAM finance bridge in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/bridge.py` so the developer screen can map the solved Case 2 physical result into the existing `Single Owner` runtime without collapsing buyer and developer metrics into one value.
- Added failing-then-passing regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_e.py`, then published the canonical Phase E artifact scripts at `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_e.py` and `scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_e_report.py`.
- Published the machine-readable Phase E artifacts at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_strike-sensitivity.json` and `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_contract-risk.json`.
- Published the synchronized Phase E HTML report at `reports/2026-04-15-dppa-case-2-phase-e.html` via the report-skill template flow.
- Real solved Phase E outcome for the current proxy-priced base case: there is no buyer/developer overlap across the tested `15%`, `10%`, `5%`, and `0%` strike discount points, the lowest buyer premium in the tested band is still about `1.55B VND` at `15%` below weighted EVN, and adding CfD exposure on excess generation would worsen buyer cost by about `4.23B VND` versus the current customer-first exclusion rule.

### Validation

- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_cd.py tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_e.py -q` - PASS (`8 passed`)
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_e.py` - PASS
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_e_report.py` - PASS

### Next-Step Seeds

- Move into Phase F with the new Case 2 Single Owner bridge, but treat the current no-overlap result as the baseline story to validate rather than assuming a financeable band exists.
- Replace the proxy market-price series before negotiating any strike recommendation, because Phase E shows the commercial screen is highly sensitive even before developer viability clears.
- Use Phase G to combine the Phase C-E buyer, developer, and contract-risk surfaces into one decision artifact that explicitly states whether the current Case 2 shape is reject, revise, or escalate for new assumptions.

## Phase 28 - DPPA Case 2 Implementation (Phase F) - 2026-04-15

- [x] Phase 1 - Read the current Phase E outputs, existing PySAM bridge/runtime surfaces, and available hourly market-price data inputs relevant to Case 2 replacement work
- [x] Phase 2 - Add failing regression coverage for market-series replacement and Phase F developer validation artifacts
- [x] Phase 3 - Implement the Case 2 hourly market-series replacement path and Phase F PySAM validation surfaces
- [x] Phase 4 - Run targeted validation commands and regenerate the canonical Phase F artifacts
- [x] Phase 5 - Publish a synchronized HTML Phase F report via the report skill flow
- [x] Phase 6 - Create the requested git commit after validation and report generation
- [x] Review / Results - Record canonical files, validations, artifacts, commit, and next-step seeds

### Notes

- Phase F should reuse the Phase E strike and contract-risk results rather than rebuilding a separate commercial baseline.
- Market-series replacement should prefer a repo-local actual or documented quasi-actual hourly series over the prior retail-scaled proxy, and the chosen source must be visible in the resulting artifacts.
- The developer-side PySAM pass should preserve buyer and developer outputs as separate surfaces, then add an explicit comparison artifact instead of blending them into one number.

### Review / Results

- Implemented the Phase F market-reference replacement and developer-validation helpers in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/dppa_case_2.py`, adding repo-local market-series selection, REopt-vs-PySAM comparison, and a final developer-screening artifact while keeping buyer and developer views separate.
- Reused the existing Case 2 PySAM bridge in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/bridge.py` and added failing-then-passing regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_f.py` to lock the market replacement and screening contracts.
- Added the canonical Phase F execution scripts at `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_f.py` and `scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_f_report.py`, and extended `scripts/python/integration/run_ninhsim_dppa_case_2.py` to regenerate Phase F outputs in the end-to-end flow.
- Published the Phase F machine-readable artifacts at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_market-reference.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_buyer-settlement-actual-market.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_buyer-benchmark-actual-market.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_pysam-results.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_reopt-pysam-comparison.json`, and `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_developer-screening.json`.
- Published the synchronized Phase F HTML report at `reports/2026-04-15-dppa-case-2-phase-f.html` via the report-skill template flow.
- Real Phase F outcome: replaced the retail-scaled proxy with the repo-local `saigon18` hourly `cfmp_vnd_per_mwh` transfer series, but the current Ninhsim Case 2 still fails both screens — buyer premium worsens to about `12.81B VND`, negative-CfD hours rise to `216`, PySAM after-tax IRR remains null with after-tax NPV about `-$47.28M`, and the combined screening decision is `reject_current_case`.
- Recorded the synchronized Phase E/F work in git commit `489b1c0` (`dppa case 2 - validate market and developer screens`).

### Validation

- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_cd.py tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_e.py tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_f.py -q` - PASS (`10 passed`)
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_f.py` - PASS
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_f_report.py` - PASS

### Next-Step Seeds

- Use Phase G to package the now-consistent buyer, contract-risk, market-reference, and PySAM artifacts into one final decision report that explicitly records the current case as reject-or-revise rather than leaving that inference implicit.
- Source a true Ninhsim hourly CFMP/FMP series if available; Phase F improves credibility over the proxy, but the transferred `saigon18` market series is still not site-specific.
- If the project remains strategically important, revisit the case definition itself in Phase G or a follow-on phase by changing strike basis, DPPA adder assumptions, or physical sizing rather than continuing to widen sensitivities around an already rejected base case.

## Phase 29 - DPPA Case 2 Implementation (Phase G) - 2026-04-15

- [x] Phase 1 - Read the current Phase C-F artifacts, combined-decision patterns, and final-report expectations relevant to the Case 2 closeout package
- [x] Phase 2 - Add failing regression coverage for the Phase G combined-decision artifact and final summary surfaces
- [x] Phase 3 - Implement the combined decision artifact and final Case 2 reporting surfaces
- [x] Phase 4 - Run targeted validation commands and regenerate the canonical Phase G artifacts
- [x] Phase 5 - Publish a synchronized HTML Phase G report via the report skill flow
- [x] Phase 6 - Publish a final Case 2 decision report if the combined package warrants a separate closeout artifact
- [x] Review / Results - Record canonical files, validations, artifacts, and final decision guidance

### Notes

- Phase G should consume the already-published Phase C-F artifacts rather than recomputing the underlying physical, buyer, or PySAM analyses again.
- The combined package should make the final decision explicit: advance, revise, reject, or escalate for new assumptions.
- A separate final report is only warranted if it adds value beyond the Phase G implementation report by summarizing the whole Case 2 journey into one closeout artifact.

### Review / Results

- Implemented the final Case 2 decision builders in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/dppa_case_2.py`, adding a combined-decision artifact that rolls up the published Phase C-F outputs and a closeout summary artifact that records the whole Case 2 phase history.
- Added failing-then-passing regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_g.py`, then added the canonical Phase G execution script at `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_g.py`.
- Published the machine-readable Phase G artifacts at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_combined-decision.json` and `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_final-summary.json`.
- Published the synchronized Phase G HTML report at `reports/2026-04-15-dppa-case-2-phase-g.html` via the report-skill template flow.
- Published a separate final closeout HTML report at `reports/2026-04-15-dppa-case-2-final.html` because the final summary explicitly warranted a compact stakeholder-facing wrap-up beyond the implementation-phase report.
- Final Case 2 outcome is now explicit and stable across all published artifacts: `recommended_position = reject_current_case`, `decision_class = reject`, market-reference quality remains `transferred_repo_local`, buyer premium is about `12.81B VND`, the lowest tested buyer premium in the sweep is still about `1.55B VND`, best tested developer NPV stays negative at about `-$45.19M`, and excess-generation CfD stress adds about `4.23B VND` in the stress case.

### Validation

- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_cd.py tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_e.py tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_f.py tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_g.py -q` - PASS (`12 passed`)
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_g.py` - PASS
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_g_report.py` - PASS
- `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_final_report.py` - PASS

### Final Decision Guidance

- Keep `DPPA Case 2` closed as `reject_current_case` under the current assumptions and transferred market basis.
- Only reopen the case if a future pass changes at least one foundational assumption materially: site-specific hourly CFMP/FMP data, strike basis, DPPA adder/KPP basis, or the physical design scope itself.
- If the case is reopened later, start from `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_combined-decision.json` and `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-15_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_final-summary.json` rather than replaying the whole phase history manually.

## Phase 25 - DPPA Case 2 Implementation (Phases A-B) - 2026-04-14

- [x] Phase A - Freeze Case 2 definition, naming, and assumptions register
- [x] Phase A Report - Publish a synchronized phase report via the report skill
- [x] Phase B - Design the Case 2 commercial settlement ledger and canonical schema surfaces
- [x] Phase B Report - Publish a synchronized phase report via the report skill
- [x] Validation - Verify the new planning/design artifacts and any added tests
- [x] Review / Results - Record canonical paths, validations, and next-step seeds

### Review / Results

- Implemented new Phase A/B helper surfaces in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/dppa_case_2.py` so Case 2 now has canonical JSON builders for the definition artifact, assumptions register, settlement design, settlement schema, and edge-case matrix.
- Added the runnable artifact-preparation entrypoint at `scripts/python/integration/prepare_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_ab.py` plus a package export update in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/__init__.py`.
- Added failing-then-passing regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_ab.py`, then validated the new Phase A/B contract end to end.
- Published the canonical design artifacts at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_phase-a-definition.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_phase-a-assumptions-register.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_phase-b-settlement-design.json`, `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_phase-b-settlement-schema.json`, and `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-14_ninhsim_dppa-case-2_phase-b-edge-case-matrix.json`.
- Generated synchronized phase reports at `reports/2026-04-14-dppa-case-2-phase-a.html` and `reports/2026-04-14-dppa-case-2-phase-b.html` using the report-skill template flow.

### Validation

- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_2_phase_ab.py -q` - PASS (`5 passed`)
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/integration/prepare_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_ab.py` - PASS
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_2_phase_reports.py` - PASS

### Next-Step Seeds

- Implement Phase C and Phase D together so the first runnable Case 2 scenario can consume the frozen settlement schema rather than inventing new field names on the fly.
- Resolve the actual-versus-proxy hourly `FMP` / `CFMP` source early in the next phase because the settlement engine is now schema-ready but still waiting on a trusted market-price series.
- Decide how the future PySAM developer-side run should ingest buyer-settlement results without collapsing them back into a single blended strike-only revenue stream.

## Phase 24 - DPPA Case 2 Planning Note - 2026-04-14

- [x] Phase 1 - Review the DPPA Case 2 readiness findings and existing plan format requirements
- [x] Phase 2 - Draft a standalone multi-phase markdown plan for `DPPA Case 2` under `plans/active/`
- [x] Phase 3 - Embed explicit review questions and recommended defaults for the user to answer inline before implementation
- [x] Review / Results - Record the canonical plan path and the recommended default direction for Case 2

### Review / Results

- Created the canonical Case 2 planning artifact at `plans/active/dppa_case_2_plan.md`, following the repo's existing DPPA planning style while shifting the commercial basis from private-wire screening to synthetic / financial DPPA settlement.
- Embedded a detailed multi-phase implementation path covering case-definition freeze, settlement-ledger design, REopt physical sizing, buyer-settlement validation, strike and contract sensitivities, optional PySAM developer validation, and final reporting.
- Added explicit review questions with recommended defaults directly into the plan so the user can answer inline before implementation starts.
- Recommended default direction: make `DPPA Case 2` the repo's first canonical synthetic-DPPA buyer-cost workflow, keep `DPPA Case 1` as the private-wire reference case, and stage PySAM after the buyer-settlement ledger is trusted.

## Phase 23 - DPPA Case 2 Readiness Review - 2026-04-14

- [x] Phase 1 - Review DPPA research markdown sources and extract the mechanism assumptions relevant to buyer-side settlement and case shaping
- [x] Phase 2 - Cross-check the implemented DPPA Case 1 plan, code, scenario, and artifacts against those research assumptions
- [x] Phase 3 - Identify updates or revisions that should be applied before a DPPA Case 2 run
- [x] Phase 4 - Publish a markdown review report with findings, risks, and recommended revisions
- [x] Review / Results - Record the report path and the main Case 2 guidance points

### Review / Results

- Reviewed the repo's sole DPPA research note at `research/2026-04-07-vietnam-dppa-buyer-guide.md` against the implemented Case 1 plan, scenario builder, REopt/PySAM bridge, runtime, and generated artifacts.
- Confirmed that `DPPA Case 1` is implemented as a `private_wire` tariff-ceiling screen, not as the synthetic / financial DPPA buyer-payment mechanism described in the buyer guide.
- Recorded the full findings and recommended revisions for `DPPA Case 2` at `reports/2026-04-14-dppa-case-2-readiness-review.md`.
- Main recommendation: split the workflow cleanly so `Case 1` remains the private-wire screen and `Case 2` becomes a new synthetic-DPPA buyer-cost model with an explicit settlement ledger, settlement-quantity rule, excess-generation treatment, and nonzero-storage enforcement if BESS is required.

## Phase 19 — Planning Surface Cleanup and Session Handoff — 2026-04-05

- [ ] Phase 1 - Resolve stale planning surfaces so `plans/active/` is the only mutable home for the PySAM reorganization roadmap
- [ ] Phase 2 - Close out the current PySAM strike-discovery phase with synchronized notes, outcomes, and next-step guidance
- [ ] Phase 3 - Generate a current-state HTML handoff report that summarizes repo status and the recommended first Vietnam analysis flow for the next session
- [ ] Validation - Regenerate the handoff artifact and verify it renders cleanly
- [ ] Review / Results - Record the canonical plan path, report path, and next-session starting commands

## Phase 15 — PySAM Integration Reorganization Plan — 2026-04-03

- [x] Phase 1 - Audit the current repository structure and identify rename, folder-move, and PySAM landing-zone requirements
- [x] Phase 2 - Draft a multi-phase PySAM integration and repository reorganization plan in a root-level `plans/` directory
- [x] Phase 3 - Capture open questions, assumptions, risks, and migration checkpoints directly in the markdown plan for offline review
- [x] Review / Results - Record the generated planning artifact path and the recommended implementation order

### Notes

- This phase is planning-only and should not rename the repository or relocate production files beyond creating the new planning home requested by the user.
- The plan should treat PySAM as a Python-layer extension that complements, rather than replaces, the existing REopt.jl and Python preprocessing workflow.

### Outputs Generated

- `plans/active/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md`

### Review / Results

- Created a new root-level planning home and placed the PySAM roadmap at `plans/active/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md` so future review can happen outside `docs/worklog/`.
- The plan recommends renaming the repository to `reopt-pysam-vn` first, then restructuring the repo into explicit REopt, PySAM, and integration domains rather than mixing new finance code into the current script-first Python layout.
- The roadmap is split into seven implementation phases: rename and planning cleanup, structural reorganization, Python packaging, PySAM MVP, REopt-plus-PySAM strike search, contract and risk extensions, and final documentation plus hardening.
- Open questions were embedded directly in the markdown plan with recommended defaults so the user can review asynchronously without interrupting the workflow.

---

## Phase 16 — PySAM Reorganization Execution (Phases 1-3) — 2026-04-03

- [x] Phase 1 - Rename the repository surfaces and relocate planning docs into the new root `plans/` structure
- [x] Phase 2 - Reorganize `src/`, `scripts/`, and `tests/` into explicit REopt, PySAM, and integration domains with compatibility shims
- [x] Phase 3 - Add Python packaging, PySAM dependency scaffolding, setup docs, and optional-test support
- [x] Validation - Run targeted checks for packaging, imports, moved paths, and test discovery
- [x] Review / Results - Record the final moved paths, rename status, validation commands, and any deferred cleanup

### Notes

- This execution pass implements the first three phases from `plans/active/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md`.
- The safest migration path is to preserve old entry points where practical while moving code into the new canonical structure.

### Outputs Expected

- Repo metadata updated for `reopt-pysam-vn`
- Archived legacy plans under `plans/archive/`
- Active plans under `plans/active/`
- Python package skeleton under `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/`
- Reorganized script and test folders with compatibility shims
- `pyproject.toml` and updated Python dependency documentation

### Interim Notes

- GitHub repository rename to `reopt-pysam-vn` succeeded and the local `origin` remote now points to the renamed repo.
- The local folder rename is still pending because a live process is holding `C:\Users\tukum\Downloads\reopt-julia-VNanalysis` open.

### Review / Results

- Moved historical planning docs into `plans/archive/`, moved the active PySAM roadmap to `plans/active/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md`, and added `plans/README.md` plus `docs/worklog/README.md` to document the new planning home.
- Reorganized code into canonical domains: `src/julia/REoptVietnam.jl`, `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/`, `scripts/python/reopt/`, `scripts/python/integration/`, `scripts/python/pysam/`, and mirrored Python test suites under `tests/python/reopt/`, `tests/python/integration/`, and `tests/python/pysam/`.
- Preserved backward compatibility by leaving thin wrapper entrypoints at the old top-level `scripts/python/*.py` paths and shim modules at `src/reopt_vietnam.py` plus `src/REoptVietnam.jl`.
- Added Phase 3 packaging and PySAM scaffolding through `pyproject.toml`, updated `requirements.txt`, `docs/pysam.md`, a PySAM smoke script at `scripts/python/pysam/run_single_owner_smoke.py`, and initial package modules under `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/pysam/` plus `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/`.
- Validation passed on the reorganized Python and PySAM scaffolding: `python -m pytest tests/python/reopt/test_unit.py -q`, `python -m pytest tests/python/reopt/test_integration.py -q -k smoke`, `python tests/cross_language/cross_validate.py`, `python -m pytest tests/python/pysam -q`, and `python scripts/python/pysam/run_single_owner_smoke.py`.
- The only incomplete Phase 1 item is the local folder rename from `reopt-julia-VNanalysis` to `reopt-pysam-vn`, which failed because another process currently has the directory open; GitHub and git remote rename work are complete.

---

## Phase 17 — Folder Blocker Cleanup and PySAM Phase 4 MVP — 2026-04-04

- [x] Phase 1 - Recheck and, if possible, clear the remaining local folder-rename blocker without disturbing the synced git state
- [x] Phase 2 - Add failing regression coverage for a real PySAM `Single Owner` developer-finance MVP
- [x] Phase 3 - Implement the first normalized Vietnam-focused PySAM finance workflow and runnable script
- [x] Phase 4 - Validate the Phase 4 workflow with targeted tests and smoke execution
- [x] Phase 5 - Publish a synchronized HTML phase report if the MVP lands cleanly
- [x] Review / Results - Record blocker status, delivered files, validation commands, and follow-up seeds

### Notes

- This phase should resolve the remaining rename blocker if it is now actionable, but should not use destructive filesystem operations.
- The modeling scope stays intentionally narrow: `Single Owner` only, wrapper-driven Vietnam defaults, canonical JSON outputs, and one runnable case-study-oriented smoke path.
- Reporting should happen promptly after validation so the phase artifact matches the delivered code and outputs.

### Review / Results

- Rechecked the old rename blocker and closed it as stale: `C:\Users\tukum\Downloads\reopt-julia-VNanalysis` no longer exists, the local folder is already `C:\Users\tukum\Downloads\reopt-pysam-vn`, and `origin` already points to `https://github.com/tah-allotrope/reopt-pysam-vn.git`.
- Added real Phase 4 PySAM execution code under `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/pysam/` plus a Ninhsim bridge in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/bridge.py`, replacing the earlier scaffolding with a runnable `CustomGenerationProfileSingleOwner` workflow that uses wrapper-driven Vietnam defaults and zeroed US-style incentives.
- Added Phase 4 regression coverage in `tests/python/pysam/test_single_owner_phase4.py` and expanded `tests/python/pysam/test_single_owner_scaffold.py` so the PySAM lane now checks both canonical Ninhsim mapping and a real local `Single Owner` execution path.
- Added runnable entrypoints at `scripts/python/integration/run_ninhsim_single_owner.py`, `scripts/python/run_ninhsim_single_owner.py`, `scripts/python/pysam/run_single_owner_smoke.py`, and published the normalized artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-04_ninhsim-single-owner-finance.json`.
- Updated `docs/pysam.md` to document the supported local `.venv` Python 3.12 path because the workstation's global Python 3.14 cannot install `nrel-pysam`; also ignored `.venv/` in `.gitignore` to keep the local runtime out of git.
- Published the synchronized HTML phase report at `reports/2026-04-04-ninhsim-pysam-phase-4-mvp.html` immediately after validation so the report stays aligned with the delivered JSON and code.

### Validation

- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/python/pysam -q` - PASS (`7 passed`)
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/integration/run_ninhsim_single_owner.py` - PASS
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/pysam/run_single_owner_smoke.py` - PASS
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_phase4_pysam_report.py` - PASS

### Follow-up Seeds

- Feed the new Phase 4 artifact into Phase 5 strike-price discovery so buyer-side REopt parity and developer-side PySAM return thresholds can be solved together instead of reviewed separately.
- Decide whether the repo should standardize on `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` for PySAM work or add a helper bootstrap script so contributors do not have to remember the supported local runtime steps.
- Add a second case-study bridge after the Phase 5 strike loop is stable so developer-side PySAM modeling does not remain Ninhsim-only.

---

## Phase 18 — PySAM Phase 5 Strike-Price Discovery — 2026-04-04

- [x] Phase 1 - Update the Phase 18 checklist, scope guardrails, and expected outputs before implementation starts
- [x] Phase 2 - Add failing regression coverage for strike-price sweep and minimum viable price discovery on top of the Phase 4 Ninhsim artifact
- [x] Phase 3 - Implement the Phase 5 strike sweep from `5.0` to `15.0` UScents/kWh in `0.5`-cent steps using the local `.venv` PySAM runtime
- [x] Phase 4 - Publish the normalized strike-discovery JSON artifact for Ninhsim
- [x] Phase 5 - Publish a synchronized HTML phase report in the same report-skill pattern as Phase 4
- [x] Phase 6 - Run the full PySAM pytest lane in `.venv` and confirm pass after Phase 5 lands
- [x] Review / Results - Record delivered files, sweep outcome, validation commands, and next-phase seeds

### Notes

- This phase must build directly on `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-04_ninhsim-single-owner-finance.json` rather than bypassing the Phase 4 artifact.
- The target business question is the minimum year-one strike in the requested sweep range that clears the target developer IRR, defaulting to `10%`.
- Reporting should follow the same shared report-template flow used in Phase 4 so the HTML artifact remains consistent.

### Outputs Expected

- `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/strike_search.py`
- `scripts/python/pysam/strike_price_discovery.py`
- `scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_phase5_strike_price_report.py`
- `scripts/python/strike_price_discovery.py`
- `scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase5_strike_price_report.py`
- `tests/python/pysam/test_strike_price_discovery.py`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-04_ninhsim-strike-price.json`
- `reports/2026-04-04-ninhsim-pysam-phase-5-strike-price.html`

### Interim Notes

- Implementation should reuse the existing `build_ninhsim_single_owner_inputs()` bridge and `run_single_owner_model()` runtime so Phase 5 stays a thin orchestration layer on top of Phase 4 rather than a duplicate finance path.
- Regression coverage should lock both the deterministic sweep mechanics and the discovered minimum viable strike so future refactors do not silently change the decision boundary.
- The final JSON should preserve the Phase 4 case metadata and add explicit sweep settings, all evaluated strike points, and a machine-readable viability decision block.

### Review / Results

- Implemented Phase 5 strike discovery in `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/strike_search.py` as a thin orchestration layer over the existing Phase 4 bridge and `Single Owner` runtime, keeping all finance assumptions fixed while sweeping only the year-one PPA strike.
- Added failing-then-passing regression coverage in `tests/python/pysam/test_strike_price_discovery.py` for both deterministic sweep behavior and the real Ninhsim boundary result against the canonical Phase 4 artifact.
- Added runnable entrypoints at `scripts/python/pysam/strike_price_discovery.py` and `scripts/python/strike_price_discovery.py`, then published the normalized sweep artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-04_ninhsim-strike-price.json`.
- Added the synchronized HTML report generator at `scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_phase5_strike_price_report.py` plus wrapper `scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase5_strike_price_report.py`, then published `reports/2026-04-04-ninhsim-pysam-phase-5-strike-price.html`.
- The requested `5.0` to `15.0` UScents/kWh sweep produced `21` evaluated strike points and found the first strike that clears the default `10%` after-tax IRR target at `15.0` UScents/kWh, which is the top end of the requested range.
- The Phase 4 baseline strike remains about `7.328` UScents/kWh and is not finance-viable under this developer-side screen; only the `15.0` UScents/kWh point met the IRR hurdle, with after-tax IRR about `10.89%`, minimum DSCR about `0.616`, and after-tax NPV still about `-$3.50M`.

### Validation

- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/python/pysam/test_strike_price_discovery.py -q` - PASS (`2 passed`)
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/pysam/strike_price_discovery.py` - PASS
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_phase5_strike_price_report.py` - PASS
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/python/pysam -q` - PASS (`9 passed`)

### Handoff Notes

- `plans/active/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md` is now the canonical roadmap; `plans/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md` remains only as a pointer so the repo no longer has duplicate editable plan copies.
- The repo is ready for the next session to either build the combined buyer-plus-developer commercial-gap artifact or run a fresh first-analysis pass from a template and the Julia scenario runner.

### Next-Step Seeds

- Extend the strike sweep above `15.0` UScents/kWh or tighten the step near the boundary if the next phase needs a more precise minimum viable strike than the current endpoint answer.
- Put the buyer-side REopt parity ceiling and the developer-side PySAM viable strike in the same artifact so the commercial gap is explicit rather than split across Phase 4 and Phase 5 outputs.
- Decide whether future developer-side screening should require a second threshold such as non-negative NPV or minimum DSCR now that the IRR-only boundary has been exposed.

## Phase 19 — Ninhsim 60% Solar + Storage DPPA Planning Note — 2026-04-06

- [x] Phase 1 - Review the current Ninhsim REopt and PySAM artifacts relevant to a `60%` demand-serving solar-plus-storage study
- [x] Phase 2 - Draft a standalone markdown plan that explains the REopt-plus-PySAM workflow and embeds clarifying questions for user review
- [x] Review / Results - Save the planning artifact under `plans/active/` and record the recommended defaults for unresolved points

### Notes

- This is a planning-only phase requested by the user; no modeling implementation should happen in this pass.
- The plan should align with the repo's existing Ninhsim workflow and explicitly distinguish buyer-side REopt sizing from developer-side PySAM finance evaluation.

### Outputs Generated

- `plans/active/ninhsim_60pct_solar_storage_dppa_plan.md`

### Review / Results

- Drafted a dedicated planning artifact for a Ninhsim `solar + storage` study that targets `60%` demand coverage and evaluates developer returns at a DPPA strike pegged to `5%` below the weighted EVN industrial tariff for `22-110 kV`.
- The plan explicitly notes that this new strike peg is lower than the prior Phase 4 commercial input, so developer finance results may weaken unless the new sizing materially changes the cost and delivery profile.
- Embedded clarifying questions directly in the plan around the `60%` target definition, wind removal, battery charging source, excess-energy treatment, strike escalation, optimization objective, and finance assumptions so the user can answer inline before implementation begins.
- Recommended default path in the plan is a customer-anchored REopt sizing pass for `solar + storage only`, followed by a PySAM `Single Owner` finance evaluation and one combined decision artifact.

---

## Phase 19 — Planning Surface Cleanup and Session Handoff — 2026-04-05

- [x] Phase 1 - Resolve stale planning surfaces so `plans/active/` is the only mutable home for the PySAM reorganization roadmap
- [x] Phase 2 - Close out the current PySAM strike-discovery phase with synchronized notes, outcomes, and next-step guidance
- [x] Phase 3 - Generate a current-state HTML handoff report that summarizes repo status and the recommended first Vietnam analysis flow for the next session
- [x] Validation - Regenerate the handoff artifact and verify it renders cleanly
- [x] Review / Results - Record the canonical plan path, report path, and next-session starting commands

### Notes

- This cleanup phase is intentionally documentation-first: it removes stale planning duplication, closes the Phase 18 execution log, and creates a practical handoff artifact for the next session.
- The handoff should guide both continuation of the Ninhsim PySAM roadmap and a clean first-run Vietnam scenario flow from the repo root.

### Outputs Generated

- `plans/active/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md`
- `plans/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md`
- `scripts/python/integration/generate_project_status_handoff_report.py`
- `scripts/python/generate_project_status_handoff_report.py`
- `reports/2026-04-05-project-status-and-first-analysis-handoff.html`

### Review / Results

- Refreshed `plans/active/pysam_integration_reorg_plan.md` as the canonical roadmap and replaced the stale root-level duplicate with a pointer-only file so the repo now follows a one-live-plan-per-topic rule under `plans/active/`.
- Closed the stale rename and packaging notes implicitly by aligning the roadmap with actual repo state: the repo is already `reopt-pysam-vn`, PySAM scaffolding and Phase 4 execution are complete, and the open integration gap is the combined buyer-plus-developer artifact.
- Published a current-state HTML handoff report at `reports/2026-04-05-project-status-and-first-analysis-handoff.html` that summarizes implemented phases, current blockers, canonical paths, and the recommended first Vietnam project analysis commands for the next session.
- The recommended next-session first analysis flow is to run a fast template validation with `julia --project --compile=min scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl --no-solve`, then solve the default template or a specific case-study scenario once API credentials and Julia are confirmed healthy.

### Validation

- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/python/integration/generate_project_status_handoff_report.py` - PASS
- Verified the generated HTML includes explicit-height Chart.js containers and current canonical paths for plans, reports, and runner commands.

## Phase 11 — Ninhsim Developer Revenue and Offtaker Cost Path — 2026-04-02

## Phase 14 — Ninhsim Commercial Candidate Memo — 2026-04-02

- [x] Phase 1 - Add failing regression coverage for a shortlist commercial memo with advance / hold / discard candidate statuses
- [x] Phase 2 - Extend the Ninhsim analysis summary with a commercial candidate memo view built from the accepted customer-first band and the remaining shortlist options
- [x] Phase 3 - Validate the refreshed Ninhsim memo artifact and persist machine-readable outputs
- [x] Phase 4 - Publish the next Ninhsim HTML phase report via the `report` skill flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record outputs, validation, and the final shortlist review endpoint

### Notes

- This phase implements the first open seed from Phase 13 by turning the accepted customer-first annual-path result into a compact decision memo for commercial review.
- The memo should preserve the customer-first framing while still showing why the alternative shortlist bands are marked advance, hold, or discard.

### Outputs Generated

- `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase14_report.py`
- `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-commercial-candidate-memo.json`
- `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-commercial-candidate-memo.html`

### Review / Results

- Extended `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py` with a `commercial_candidate_memo` decision layer that converts the already-accepted customer-first band and the remaining shortlist into direct `advance`, `hold`, and `discard` actions.
- Kept the memo logic intentionally simple and policy-driven: the accepted customer-first band is marked `advance`, any non-premium fallback band is marked `hold`, and any shortlist band with positive customer premium is marked `discard`.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py` that first failed on the missing memo API, then locked the exact shortlist status mapping and the presence of `commercial_candidate_memo` in the summary payload.
- Refreshed the machine-readable artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-commercial-candidate-memo.json`; the final memo decision is to advance `5% below ceiling` as the primary commercial candidate, keep `ceiling` only as fallback, and discard `5% above ceiling` because it creates explicit customer premium.
- The memo now gives the shortlist in one place: `5% below ceiling` -> `advance` at about `1934.50 VND/kWh` with customer savings NPV about `$6.45M`; `ceiling` -> `hold` at about `2036.31 VND/kWh` with parity economics; `5% above ceiling` -> `discard` at about `2138.13 VND/kWh` because it adds customer premium NPV about `$6.45M`.
- Published the synchronized HTML artifact at `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-commercial-candidate-memo.html` via the report-template flow so the final shortlist can be reviewed visually without opening raw JSON.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py --reopt artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim_scenario-b_optimized-cppa_reopt-results.json --extracted data/interim/ninhsim/ninhsim_extracted_inputs.json --output artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-commercial-candidate-memo.json` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase14_report.py` - PASS

### Clear Review Endpoint

- Review `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-commercial-candidate-memo.json` or `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-commercial-candidate-memo.html` and confirm the final shortlist action labels.
- The decision question for this phase is no longer which band is best; it is whether you agree to carry `5% below ceiling` forward as the lead commercial candidate, with `ceiling` as fallback and `5% above ceiling` removed from the active commercial path.

### Next-Step Seeds

- Package the `advance` candidate into a shorter external-facing negotiation memo or slide page that strips away the internal modeling detail and focuses on the commercial ask, customer protection, and fallback path.
- If commercial stakeholders want more downside stress testing before outreach, run a merchant-price scenario range around the accepted candidate and refresh the memo only if the advance / hold / discard statuses change.

## Phase 13 — Ninhsim Customer-First Finance-Grade Annual Path — 2026-04-02

- [x] Phase 1 - Add failing regression coverage for a customer-first annual path with degradation, load drift, and unmatched-energy treatment
- [x] Phase 2 - Extend the Ninhsim pricing analysis summary with a finance-grade annual path that preserves the customer-preferred strike band and shows customer-risk tradeoffs explicitly
- [x] Phase 3 - Validate the refreshed Ninhsim finance-grade artifact and persist machine-readable outputs
- [x] Phase 4 - Publish the next Ninhsim HTML phase report via the `report` skill flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record outputs, validation, and the final customer-first review endpoint

### Notes

- This phase implements the second open seed from Phase 12 by carrying the customer-preferred shortlist into a richer annual path that includes degradation, load drift, and unmatched-energy handling.
- Customer best interest should drive the defaults for this pass, so the annual path should center the best savings-positive shortlist band unless the refreshed volume model proves it stops being customer-favorable.

### Outputs Generated

- `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase13_report.py`
- `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-customer-first-annual-path.json`
- `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-customer-first-annual-path.html`

### Review / Results

- Extended `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py` with a `customer_first_recommendation` selector and a `customer_first_annual_path` that replays the solved Ninhsim delivery plus export shapes under a richer annual path instead of the prior fixed-volume simplification.
- Kept the default recommendation customer-protective by design: from the Phase 12 shortlist, the analyzer now selects the highest developer-revenue band that still leaves positive customer savings in the screening view, which keeps `5% below ceiling` as the recommended band instead of drifting up to parity or premium pricing.
- Added new annual-path assumptions explicitly to the summary payload: renewable degradation `0.5%/yr`, load growth `1.0%/yr`, and unmatched-energy monetization at about `33.2%` of the EVN benchmark, using the extracted wholesale-to-retail ratio as a merchant-price proxy.
- Implemented the finance-grade annual path so unmatched renewable energy is handled outside the customer bill and credited only to developer merchant revenue, which keeps the customer-cost side conservative and aligned with the user instruction to prioritize customer best interest.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py` that first failed on the missing annual-path API, then locked the degradation, load drift, unmatched-energy treatment, and the presence of the customer-first recommendation in the summary payload.
- Refreshed the machine-readable artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-customer-first-annual-path.json`; the recommended `5% below ceiling` band stays at year-one strike about `1934.50 VND/kWh`, screening savings NPV about `$6.45M`, and finance-grade customer savings NPV about `$6.47M` with zero customer premium.
- The richer annual path shows year-one unmatched renewable energy about `3.42 GWh`, declining to about `0.19 GWh` by year 20 as load growth absorbs more production even while renewable output degrades modestly.
- Under the customer-first annual path, year-one customer savings remain about `$0.53M`, year-20 customer savings rise to about `$1.32M`, year-one developer revenue is about `$10.22M`, and only about `$0.10M` of that year-one developer revenue comes from merchant handling of unmatched output.
- Published the synchronized HTML artifact at `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-customer-first-annual-path.html` via the report-template flow so the customer-first economics and annual volume path can be reviewed visually.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py --reopt artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim_scenario-b_optimized-cppa_reopt-results.json --extracted data/interim/ninhsim/ninhsim_extracted_inputs.json --output artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-customer-first-annual-path.json` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase13_report.py` - PASS

### Clear Review Endpoint

- Review `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-customer-first-annual-path.json` or `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-customer-first-annual-path.html` and confirm whether the recommended `5% below ceiling` band is acceptable as the customer-first commercial position.
- The key review question is now narrower than in Phase 12: do you want to carry forward a band that still preserves about `$6.47M` customer savings NPV under the richer annual path, or do you want to revert to exact parity for negotiation simplicity even though the customer-favorable band still holds up?

### Next-Step Seeds

- Turn the recommended `5% below ceiling` band into a compact commercial memo view with advance / hold / discard framing, now that the customer-first annual path has stayed savings-positive under richer assumptions.
- If the merchant-price proxy needs more confidence, replace the wholesale-ratio shortcut with a project-specific merchant scenario range so the customer-first recommendation can be stress-tested further.

## Phase 12 — Ninhsim Strike Sensitivity Bands — 2026-04-02

- [x] Phase 1 - Add failing regression coverage for strike sensitivity bands around the customer-equivalent CPPA ceiling
- [x] Phase 2 - Extend the Ninhsim pricing analysis summary with developer-revenue and offtaker-savings sensitivity views
- [x] Phase 3 - Validate the refreshed Ninhsim sensitivity artifact and persist machine-readable outputs
- [x] Phase 4 - Publish the next Ninhsim HTML phase report via the `report` skill flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record outputs, validation, and the clear review endpoint for user decision

### Notes

- This phase implements the first open seed from Phase 11 by turning the current zero-savings screening point into a strike-band decision screen around the customer-equivalent ceiling.
- The endpoint for user review should be a compact shortlist view that makes it easy to compare developer revenue upside against offtaker savings or premium tradeoffs without re-solving REopt.

### Outputs Generated

- `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase12_report.py`
- `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-strike-sensitivity.json`
- `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-strike-sensitivity-bands.html`

### Review / Results

- Extended `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py` with explicit `strike_sensitivity_bands` output built around the customer-equivalent CPPA ceiling, using default strike adjustments of `-15%`, `-10%`, `-5%`, `0%`, and `+5%` without re-solving REopt.
- Kept the scope aligned with the prior Ninhsim passes: each band still replays the solved year-one renewable delivery and residual EVN supply volumes across the 20-year horizon while escalating prices at the existing `elec_cost_escalation_rate_fraction` and discounting with the REopt owner/offtaker discount rates already present in the result JSON.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py` that first failed on the missing sensitivity-band API, then locked the savings/parity/premium tradeoff behavior and the presence of `strike_sensitivity_bands` in the summary payload.
- Fixed an implementation bug during the phase: the first sensitivity pass showed a tiny false premium at the ceiling because the benchmark comparison used replayed delivered volume instead of total load and carried floating-point residue; the analyzer now benchmarks against total load and clamps near-zero deltas to keep the parity band exactly neutral.
- Refreshed the machine-readable artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-strike-sensitivity.json`; the current band sweep yields developer revenue NPV about `$130.07M` at `15% below ceiling`, `$145.38M` at `5% below ceiling`, `$153.03M` at `ceiling`, and `$160.68M` at `5% above ceiling`.
- The corresponding customer economics now create a clean tradeoff ladder: offtaker savings NPV about `$19.36M` at `15% below ceiling`, `$12.91M` at `10% below ceiling`, `$6.45M` at `5% below ceiling`, exact parity at `ceiling`, and customer premium NPV about `$6.45M` at `5% above ceiling`.
- Added an explicit `review_endpoint` block to the artifact and synchronized HTML report so the immediate shortlist for user review is `5% below ceiling`, `ceiling`, and `5% above ceiling`.
- Published the synchronized HTML artifact at `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-strike-sensitivity-bands.html` via the report-template flow with explicit-height Chart.js containers so the report stays browser-safe.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py --reopt artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim_scenario-b_optimized-cppa_reopt-results.json --extracted data/interim/ninhsim/ninhsim_extracted_inputs.json --output artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-strike-sensitivity.json` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/generate_ninhsim_phase12_report.py` - PASS

### Clear Review Endpoint

- Review `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-strike-sensitivity.json` or `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-strike-sensitivity-bands.html` and choose one of the three shortlist bands: `5% below ceiling`, `ceiling`, or `5% above ceiling`.
- The decision question for the next phase is whether the team wants to prioritize customer savings, exact parity, or higher developer revenue with an explicit customer premium before investing in a more finance-grade multi-year volume model.

### Next-Step Seeds

- Carry the chosen shortlist band into a finance-grade annual path that includes degradation, load drift, and unmatched-energy treatment so the preferred commercial position is tested against more realistic volume assumptions.
- If the user wants a more negotiation-ready output before that richer model, add a compact candidate-comparison memo view that turns the three shortlist bands into a direct advance / hold / discard screen.

---

- [x] Phase 1 - Add failing regression coverage for multi-year Ninhsim developer-revenue and offtaker-cost views derived from the escalated CPPA path
- [x] Phase 2 - Extend the Ninhsim pricing analysis summary with developer revenue, customer cost, and screening NPV views
- [x] Phase 3 - Validate the refreshed Ninhsim financial-view artifact and persist machine-readable outputs
- [x] Phase 4 - Publish the next Ninhsim HTML phase report via the `report` skill flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record outputs, validation, and next-step seeds after completion

### Notes

- This phase implements the second open seed from Phase 10 by extending the multi-year CPPA pricing path into developer-revenue and offtaker-cost screening views without re-solving REopt.
- The implementation should stay explicit about scope: this is a post-processed contract-screening view, not a full project finance model.

### Outputs Generated

- `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-financial-screening.json`
- `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-developer-revenue-and-offtaker-cost-path.html`
- `lessons.md`

### Review / Results

- Extended `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py` with a `financial_screening_view` that projects annual developer revenue, offtaker renewable payment, residual EVN cost, and total customer cost directly from the already-solved multi-year bundled-CPPA path.
- Kept the scope intentionally narrow and explicit: this pass still replays the solved year-one renewable delivery and residual grid volumes, then discounts the annual screening values using the REopt financial discount rates already present in the result JSON.
- Added discounted screening outputs to the summary payload: `developer_revenue_npv_usd`, `offtaker_cost_npv_usd`, `benchmark_evn_cost_npv_usd`, and `offtaker_savings_npv_usd`.
- Refreshed the machine-readable artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-financial-screening.json`; the current screening view yields developer revenue NPV about `$153.03M`, offtaker cost NPV about `$170.69M`, and benchmark EVN cost NPV essentially the same because the strike path stays at the customer-equivalent ceiling.
- Added two new regressions in `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py` that lock the annual finance-view math and the presence of the new NPV fields in the summary.
- Recorded a repo lesson in `lessons.md` after the user-found report bug: future Chart.js report canvases should always sit inside explicit-height containers and be browser-verified over HTTP.
- Published the synchronized HTML artifact at `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-developer-revenue-and-offtaker-cost-path.html` via the report skill flow.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py --reopt artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim_scenario-b_optimized-cppa_reopt-results.json --extracted data/interim/ninhsim/ninhsim_extracted_inputs.json --output artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-financial-screening.json` - PASS

### Next-Step Seeds

- Add sensitivity bands around the customer-equivalent strike ceiling so the Ninhsim workflow can show offtaker savings or premium tradeoffs, not just the zero-savings screening point.
- Replace the fixed-volume replay with a more finance-grade path that captures degradation, load drift, and any merchant handling for unmatched renewable output.

## Phase 10 — Ninhsim Escalated CPPA Strike Path — 2026-04-02

- [x] Phase 1 - Add failing regression coverage for a full multi-year Ninhsim bundled-CPPA strike path tied to EVN tariff escalation
- [x] Phase 2 - Extend the Ninhsim CPPA analysis workflow to compute the annual escalated strike and customer blended price path
- [x] Phase 3 - Validate the updated Ninhsim pricing analysis and persist refreshed machine-readable artifacts
- [x] Phase 4 - Publish the next Ninhsim HTML phase report via the `report` skill flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record outputs, validation, and follow-up notes after completion

### Notes

- This phase implements the first next-step seed from Phase 9 by extending the customer-equivalent strike logic beyond year 1 into a full escalated path aligned with EVN tariff growth assumptions already embedded in the Ninhsim REopt inputs.
- The report should be generated promptly after validation so the HTML artifact stays in sync with the refreshed JSON analysis output.

### Outputs Generated

- `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-escalated-analysis.json`
- `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-escalated-cppa-strike-path.html`

### Review / Results

- Added a multi-year bundled-CPPA pricing path to `scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py` so the Ninhsim post-processing now carries the year-1 customer-equivalent strike forward across the full 20-year analysis horizon using the scenario's `elec_cost_escalation_rate_fraction`.
- Kept this pass intentionally simple and explicit: the solved year-one renewable delivery and residual EVN supply volumes stay fixed while the CPPA strike, residual EVN unit price, and weighted EVN benchmark all escalate together at `5%` per year.
- Embedded the new `multi_year_cppa_path` block directly in the JSON summary so downstream scripts and reports can consume the full annual strike path without re-deriving it.
- Refreshed the machine-readable Ninhsim pricing artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-escalated-analysis.json`; the year-1 maximum equivalent bundled strike remains `2036.31 VND/kWh`, and the year-20 escalated strike reaches `5145.66 VND/kWh` while the blended customer price tracks the escalated EVN benchmark each year.
- Added two regression tests: one locks the annual escalation math, and one locks the presence of the new `multi_year_cppa_path` in the summary payload.
- Published the synchronized HTML phase report at `reports/2026-04-02-ninhsim-escalated-cppa-strike-path.html` using the report skill template flow.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/integration/analyze_ninhsim_cppa.py --reopt artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim_scenario-b_optimized-cppa_reopt-results.json --extracted data/interim/ninhsim/ninhsim_extracted_inputs.json --output artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-02_ninhsim-cppa-escalated-analysis.json` - PASS

### Next-Step Seeds

- Replace the fixed-volume annual replay with a richer multi-year path that captures degradation, load drift, or changing renewable output if the pricing study needs a more finance-grade escalation model.
- Extend the same multi-year framing into settlement, developer cash flow, or offtaker savings views so the escalated strike path can feed investment-decision artifacts directly.

## Phase 9 — Ninhsim CPPA Optimization Workflow — 2026-04-01

- [x] Phase 1 - Build Ninhsim extracted-input workflow with cleaned 8760 load, benchmark EVN tariff, and CPPA target metadata
- [x] Phase 2 - Build Ninhsim REopt scenario generator for baseline EVN and optimized solar plus BESS plus wind cases
- [x] Phase 3 - Build Ninhsim analysis workflow that searches for the optimal mix under the bundled CPPA weighted-price constraint
- [x] Phase 4 - Validate with targeted tests and at least one no-solve / solve path where feasible
- [x] Phase 5 - Publish phase reports in `reports/` using the report skill template flow
- [x] Review / Results - Record assumptions, outputs, validation, and next-step seeds after completion

### Notes

- User requested phased implementation with timely report generation and confirmed the resource location should use latitude `12.525729252783036` and longitude `109.02003383567742`.
- CPPA structure for this pass is a bundled escalating strike: renewable energy sold under CPPA pricing while residual unmet load remains on EVN TOU.
- The weighted-price target should be anchored to the Ninhsim load under the current industrial EVN TOU at `medium_voltage_22kv_to_110kv`.

### Outputs Generated

- `reports/2026-04-01-ninhsim-phase-1-data-and-scenario-preparation.html`

### Review / Results

- Rebuilt the Ninhsim extracted inputs and scenario JSONs so the optimized scenario now embeds a synthetic `Wind.production_factor_series` fallback after confirming the NREL Wind Toolkit has no data at the exact user-supplied coordinate.
- Confirmed the repo-specific schema fix remains in place: executable `Site` contains only latitude and longitude, while `customer_type`, `region`, and `voltage_level` stay in `_meta.site` so `Scenario()` construction succeeds.
- Ran the focused Ninhsim regression suite and it now passes at `4 passed`, including a new regression that accepts Wind energy from either `year_one_energy_produced_kwh` or `annual_energy_produced_kwh` in REopt outputs.
- Validated the optimized Ninhsim scenario with Julia `--no-solve` and then solved it locally with HiGHS; the solve completed `optimal` and saved to `artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim_scenario-b_optimized-cppa_reopt-results.json`.
- Solved optimal mix for this pass: `14.283 MW` PV, `40.0 MW` wind, and `0.336 MW / 1.249 MWh` BESS, with year-one renewable delivery `138.178 GWh`, residual grid supply `46.108 GWh`, and project NPV about `$33.37M`.
- Post-processed the solved dispatch into the bundled-CPPA customer-price summary at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim-cppa-analysis.json`; the year-1 customer-equivalent maximum bundled strike is `2036.31 VND/kWh` (`0.077133 USD/kWh`) while the weighted EVN benchmark is `2018.88 VND/kWh`.
- The customer blended price at that ceiling exactly matches the weighted EVN benchmark in the current year-1 formulation, which means this pass is complete for the requested same-weighted-price screen.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_ninhsim_cppa.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `julia --project --compile=min scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl --scenario scenarios/case_studies/ninhsim/2026-04-01_ninhsim_scenario-b_optimized-cppa.json --no-solve` - PASS

### Next-Step Seeds

- Extend the CPPA pricing logic from a year-1 customer-equivalent strike ceiling to a full multi-year escalated strike path tied to EVN tariff growth, because the user explicitly described future escalation behavior.
- Generate the next report-skill-style HTML artifact for the solved Ninhsim optimization and pricing results now that the local solve and JSON summary are complete.


## Phase 8 — Case Study Offtaker Physical Match Ranking — 2026-04-01

- [x] Phase 1 - Build a reproducible case-study physical-fit ranking script for a 30 MWp solar + 6 MW BESS offtaker screen
- [x] Phase 2 - Generate ranked outputs and persist artifacts for all six case studies
- [x] Phase 3 - Publish a report-skill-style HTML phase report for the physical-match ranking pass
- [x] Validation - Run targeted regression coverage for the ranking workflow
- [x] Review / Results - Record ranking, caveats, and generated report paths after completion

### Notes

- User requested ranking for pure physical load matching, not contract-structure preference.
- The screening basis is a 30 MWp solar project in Ninh Thuan with BESS capped at 20% of solar capacity, treated here as 6 MW BESS power.

### Outputs Generated

- `scripts/python/rank_case_study_offtakers.py`
- `tests/python/integration/test_case_study_ranking.py`
- `artifacts/reports/case_studies/2026-04-01_offtaker-physical-match-ranking.json`
- `reports/2026-04-01-case-study-offtaker-physical-match-ranking.html`
- `lessons.md`

### Review / Results

- Added `scripts/python/rank_case_study_offtakers.py` to normalize mixed CSV, XLSX, and JSON case-study inputs and rank them for pure physical absorption of a common 30 MWp solar profile with a 6 MW BESS headroom proxy.
- Reused the embedded `PV.production_factor_series` in `scenarios/case_studies/saigon18/2026-03-20_scenario-a_fixed-sizing_evntou.json` as the shared south-central Vietnam hourly solar shape because the North Thuan case-study JSON does not store an explicit hourly PV factor series.
- Added cleaning logic that interpolates missing placeholder cells and clips negative hourly loads to zero without changing the 8760-hour record count.
- Persisted the machine-readable ranking artifact in `artifacts/reports/case_studies/2026-04-01_offtaker-physical-match-ranking.json` and a report-skill-style HTML review page in `reports/2026-04-01-case-study-offtaker-physical-match-ranking.html`.
- Final physical-fit ranking: `north_thuan` (fit score 95.8), `ninhsim` (93.4), `saigon18` (89.4), `verdant` (38.9), `emivest` (32.4), `regina` (30.7).
- `north_thuan` is the cleanest physical match because it absorbs 100.0% of the replayed solar profile with the 6 MW BESS proxy and effectively eliminates curtailment in the screening model.
- `ninhsim` and `saigon18` both absorb nearly all annual solar energy with the 6 MW proxy, but `saigon18` falls behind `ninhsim` because its solar-hour minimum load reaches 0 MW while `ninhsim` maintains a healthier floor around 11.74 MW.
- `verdant`, `emivest`, and `regina` remain poor direct offtaker fits for a 30 MWp plant because even with the 6 MW proxy they leave large residual curtailment volumes.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_case_study_ranking.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/rank_case_study_offtakers.py` - PASS

### Review / Results

- Added `scripts/python/build_north_thuan_load_profile.py` to create a deterministic 8760 industrial load profile, derived FMP proxy, and synthetic wind production-factor fallback from the staff PDF summary inputs.
- Added `scripts/python/build_north_thuan_reopt_input.py` and `scripts/python/run_north_thuan_reopt.py` so North Thuan now has the same build/run workflow shape as Saigon18.
- Updated `scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl` so `scenarios/case_studies/north_thuan/` solves save into `artifacts/results/north_thuan/` automatically.
- Added `scripts/python/integration/compare_north_thuan_reopt_vs_staff.py`, `scripts/python/integration/generate_north_thuan_reopt_report.py`, and `tests/python/integration/test_north_thuan_reopt.py` for solved-result comparison, HTML reporting, and regression coverage.
- Extended `scripts/python/reopt/dppa_settlement.py` with `compute_virtual_dppa_developer_revenue()` for the North Thuan virtual-DPPA revenue check without breaking the existing Saigon18 settlement path.
- Generated six report-skill-style phase reports in `reports/` using `scripts/python/integration/generate_north_thuan_phase_reports.py` and the shared `report-template.html` shell.

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_north_thuan_reopt.py -v --tb=short` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/run_north_thuan_reopt.py --scenarios a --no-solve` - PASS
- `python scripts/python/run_north_thuan_reopt.py --scenarios a` - PASS after switching Wind to a synthetic `production_factor_series` fallback

### Key Results

- Scenario A solved optimally at fixed 30 MW solar + 20 MW wind + 10 MW / 40 MWh BESS.
- Scenario A energy comparison vs staff: solar 45.87 GWh (-10.1%, WARN), wind 66.58 GWh (-0.0%, OK), total RE 112.44 GWh (-4.4%, OK), matched volume 110.32 GWh (+57.5%, WARN), RE penetration 46.68% (-4.4%, OK), self-consumption 98.11% (+64.6%, WARN), factory NPV proxy $6.51M (-18.4%, WARN).
- Scenario B optimized to 24.59 MW solar, 50.00 MW wind, and no storage with factory NPV proxy $35.04M.
- Scenario C no-BESS baseline solved at the staff generation sizes with factory NPV proxy $18.66M.
- DPPA settlement post-processing landed at $6.07M year-1 developer revenue versus the staff $6.0M claim (+1.1%, OK).

### Known Limitations From This Pass

- The North Thuan proxy coordinate remains outside the NREL wind-resource coverage used by REopt's default Wind Toolkit fetch, so the workflow now intentionally uses a synthetic `Wind.production_factor_series` fallback.
- The synthetic load profile and flat year-1 FMP proxy materially affect matched volume and self-consumption, so those WARNs should be treated as model-input sensitivity rather than final project conclusions.

## Phase 2 Bug Log — Script Fixes Applied

### Bug 1: `equity_irr.py` — EBITDA uses discounted NPV not nominal savings ✅ FIXED (2026-03-22)

**Root cause:** `extract_annual_ebitda()` computed `lcc_bau - lcc_opt` which equals the NPV
(both LCC values are present-value lifecycle costs). It then divided this discounted total
by a nominal escalation factor sum, producing a severely understated year-1 CF (~$319K
instead of ~$5.93M). This drove equity IRR to −17.9% — a model artifact, not a real result.

**Fix applied:** `extract_annual_ebitda()` now uses
`Financial.year_one_total_operating_cost_savings_before_tax` ($5,929,979) as year-1 base,
grown at `elec_cost_escalation_rate_fraction` (default 5%) each year.

**Rerun result:** `artifacts/reports/saigon18/2026-03-22_equity-irr_summary.json` now shows
19.8% equity IRR vs Excel 19.4% (+0.4%), confirming the earlier −17.9% was a script artifact.

### Bug 2: `compare_reopt_vs_excel.py` — energy flow keys don't match REopt output ✅ FIXED (2026-03-22)

**Root cause:** Script looks for keys like `year_one_to_load_kwh`, `year_one_to_grid_kwh`,
`year_one_to_load_series_kw` (BESS) which don't exist in the results JSON. Actual keys:

| Metric | Wrong key used | Correct key | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| PV to load | `pv.year_one_to_load_kwh` | `sum(pv.electric_to_load_series_kw)` | PV (series sum) |
| PV to grid | `pv.year_one_to_grid_kwh` | `pv.annual_energy_exported_kwh` | PV scalar |
| BESS discharge | `storage.year_one_to_load_series_kw` | sum of BESS series (not in scalar output) | ElectricStorage |
| Grid purchases | `utility.year_one_energy_supplied_kwh` | `utility.annual_energy_supplied_kwh` | ElectricUtility |
| Year-1 revenue | `npv / 25` | `fin.year_one_total_operating_cost_savings_before_tax` | Financial |

**Fix applied:** `load_reopt_metrics()` now reads the actual REopt result schema:
- PV production from `PV.year_one_energy_produced_kwh`
- PV non-export delivery as `year_one_energy_produced_kwh - annual_energy_exported_kwh`
- PV export from `PV.annual_energy_exported_kwh`
- BESS discharge from `ElectricStorage.storage_to_load_series_kw`
- Grid purchases from `ElectricUtility.annual_energy_supplied_kwh`
- Year-1 revenue from `Financial.year_one_total_operating_cost_savings_before_tax`

Added regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_saigon18_compare.py` to lock this mapping.

**Actual values (Scenario A, corrected report):**
- PV to grid: 549 MWh (REopt) vs Excel 1,087 MWh — Decree 57 cap partially effective
- Grid purchases: 117,705 MWh (REopt) vs Excel 112,454 MWh — +4.7%, within range
- Year-1 savings: $5.93M (REopt) vs $5.06M (Excel) — +17%, reasonable given TOU optimization
- BESS discharge: 17,956 MWh (REopt annual storage-to-load throughput) vs Excel 8,591 MWh — large gap remains and likely needs tariff-period disaggregation for apples-to-apples comparison

---

## API Compatibility Fixes Applied (REopt.jl)

The installed REopt.jl package has a newer API than the scripts assumed. Fixed in this session:

| Old field | New field | File |
|---|---|---|
| `ElectricStorage.min_soc_fraction` | `soc_min_fraction` | `build_saigon18_reopt_input.py` |
| `ElectricStorage.max_soc_fraction` | *(removed — defaults to 1.0)* | `build_saigon18_reopt_input.py` |
| `ElectricStorage.om_cost_per_kwh` | `om_cost_fraction_of_installed_cost` | `build_saigon18_reopt_input.py` |
| `ElectricTariff.energy_rate_series_per_kwh` | `tou_energy_rates_per_kwh` | `reopt_vietnam.py` + `build_saigon18_reopt_input.py` |
| `ElectricTariff.net_metering_limit_kw` | *(removed)* | `reopt_vietnam.py` |
| `ElectricTariff.export_rate_beyond_curtailment_limit` | `export_rate_beyond_net_metering_limit` | `reopt_vietnam.py` |
| `schedule["sunday"]` key | dynamic fallback to `"sunday_and_public_holidays"` | `reopt_vietnam.py` |
| Runner script `get(String, String, String)` crash at line 126 | `status = "unknown"` default | `run_vietnam_scenario.jl` |

Tariff data fix: added `"industrial"` alias block (with `high_voltage_above_35kv_below_220kv` and `medium_voltage_22kv_to_110kv` keys) to `data/vietnam/vn_tariff_2025.json` — the v2025.2 update renamed it to `"production"` but all scripts/tests still use `"industrial"`.

## Validation Status Update (2026-03-23)

The tariff v2025.2 schema drift in both Julia and Python test suites was fixed in this session.

| Validation scope | Result |
|---|---|
| `tests/python/reopt/test_data_validation.py` | PASS |
| `tests/python/reopt/test_unit.py` | PASS |
| `tests/cross_language/cross_validate.py` | PASS |
| `tests/python/reopt/test_integration.py` | PASS (1 skipped API block) |
| `tests/julia/test_data_validation.jl` | PASS |
| `tests/julia/test_unit.jl` | PASS |

Known environment noise remains on Julia startup from ArchGDAL method-overwrite precompile warnings, but it did not block scenario solves or the relevant validation passes.

---

## Next Actions

1. **Refine BESS comparison metric** — the report now uses actual REopt storage output keys, but it compares Excel's peak+standard dispatch target against total annual `storage_to_load_series_kw`. Next refinement should split REopt discharge by tariff period for apples-to-apples validation.

2. **Refresh Scenario A / Scenario C comparison artifacts** now that both were re-solved through the hard export-cap path.

3. **Add `tests/python/test_saigon18_integration.py`** for the Saigon18 real-project pipeline.

4. **Refine BESS comparison metric by tariff period** for apples-to-apples Excel vs REopt validation.

5. **Optional fixed BESS dispatch window constraints (Option B)** if comparison to the Excel control logic becomes the priority.

---

## Review / Results — 2026-03-23 Decree 57 Hard Export Cap

### What changed

- Added a Vietnam-specific solver wrapper `run_vietnam_reopt` in `src/julia/REoptVietnam.jl` that builds the REopt JuMP model, injects a hard annual PV export cap constraint, then solves and post-processes results.
- `apply_decree57_export!` now stores `decree57_max_export_fraction` in `_meta` so scenario JSONs carry the intended cap into the Julia solve path.
- `scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl` now uses `run_vietnam_reopt(...)` instead of plain `run_reopt(...)`, so scenario runs honor the Decree 57 cap automatically.
- Added a Julia integration test scenario that verifies annual PV exports are capped at 20% of annual PV production.
- Updated Julia/Python tariff preprocessing and validation tests for the tariff v2025.2 schema (`tou_energy_rates_per_kwh`, commercial subcategories, `sunday_and_public_holidays`, legacy voltage aliases).
- Rebuilt Scenario C and re-solved Scenario A + Scenario C through the hard export-cap runner.

### Targeted validation

- Focused synthetic Julia solve passed with `status=optimal`.
- Validation result: `annual_energy_exported_kwh = 175,200`, `annual_energy_produced_kwh = 876,000`, export fraction `= 0.2000` (exactly at the Decree 57 cap).
- Scenario A rerun passed with fixed design intact and export fraction `0.80%`, well below the 20% cap.
- Scenario C solve passed and selected `42.67 MWp PV` with `0 MW / 0 MWh BESS`; export fraction `6.47%`, also below the cap.

### Known remaining issues

- Scenario comparison/report artifacts have not yet been regenerated for Scenario A/C after the hard export-cap reruns.
- Julia startup still emits ArchGDAL precompile noise in this environment, but solves and tests complete successfully.

## Review / Results — 2026-03-24 Low-Risk Repository Reorganization

### What changed

- Moved Layer 3 cross-validation to the canonical path `tests/cross_language/cross_validate.py` and added `tests/cross_validate.py` as a backward-compatible wrapper for direct script and pytest usage.
- Moved worklog plan and research notes into `plans/archive/` and `docs/worklog/research/` to better separate stable docs from active project process material.
- Updated `tests/run_all_tests.ps1`, `README.md`, `docs/testing.md`, and `activeContext.md` to point at the canonical paths.

### Targeted validation

- `python tests/cross_language/cross_validate.py` — PASS
- `python tests/cross_validate.py` — PASS (legacy wrapper path)
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\run_all_tests.ps1 -Layer 3 -JuliaTimeoutSeconds 1200` — PASS

### Compatibility notes

- The old `tests/cross_validate.py` entrypoint still works for both direct execution and pytest collection.
- Worklog material now lives only under `docs/worklog/`; the temporary redirect folders were removed in the follow-up cleanup pass.

---

## Review / Results — 2026-03-24 Case-Study Assets and Artifacts Reorganization

### What changed

- Moved the Saigon18 source workbook into `data/raw/saigon18/2026-01-29_saigon18_excel_model_v2.xlsm` and the extracted JSON into `data/interim/saigon18/2026-03-20_saigon18_extracted_inputs.json`.
- Moved Saigon18 scenario JSON files into `scenarios/case_studies/saigon18/` and renamed them with dates plus descriptive scenario labels to make the work timeline easier to scan.
- Moved optimization outputs and reports into the canonical `artifacts/results/` and `artifacts/reports/` trees, with timeline-friendly filenames like `2026-03-23_scenario-a_fixed-sizing_evntou_reopt-results.json`.
- Updated Python script defaults, the Julia scenario runner, `.claude/settings.local.json`, and the Saigon18 regression test to use the new canonical paths.
- Consolidated old placeholder-folder notes into `legacy/README.md` and prepared the redundant empty legacy directories for removal.
- Regenerated the canonical Scenario D JSON and refreshed the canonical comparison and equity-IRR artifacts using the renamed paths.

### Targeted validation

- `python scripts/python/reopt/build_saigon18_reopt_input.py` — PASS
- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_saigon18_data.py -v --tb=short` — PASS
- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_saigon18_compare.py -v --tb=short` — PASS
- `python scripts/python/reopt/compare_reopt_vs_excel.py --reopt artifacts/results/saigon18/2026-03-23_scenario-a_fixed-sizing_evntou_reopt-results.json --scenario "A (fixed sizing EVN TOU)"` — PASS
- `python scripts/python/reopt/equity_irr.py --reopt artifacts/results/saigon18/2026-03-23_scenario-a_fixed-sizing_evntou_reopt-results.json --capex 49510000` — PASS
- `JULIA_PKG_PRECOMPILE_AUTO=0 julia --project --compile=min scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl --scenario scenarios/case_studies/saigon18/2026-03-20_scenario-a_fixed-sizing_evntou.json --no-solve` — PASS

### Compatibility notes

- Legacy path guidance now lives in `legacy/README.md`, and the redundant empty placeholder folders have been removed.
- Historical artifact filenames now encode both the work date and the scenario/report purpose, which should make the sequence of the Saigon18 analysis easier to follow.

---

## Review / Results — 2026-03-24 Legacy Folder Consolidation

### What changed

- Removed the redundant empty compatibility folders under the old `data/real_project/`, `scenarios/real_project/`, `results/`, and `reports/` locations.
- Consolidated the old-to-new folder mapping into one place: `legacy/README.md`.
- Updated `README.md` and `activeContext.md` so they point to the consolidated legacy index instead of scattered placeholder README files.

### Validation

- Verified the repo root no longer contains the redundant `results/` or `reports/` placeholder trees.
- Verified no code, docs, or tests still depend on those removed folders.

---

## Review / Results — 2026-03-24 Final Root Cleanup

### What changed

- Removed the last redirect-only root folder, `plans/`, after confirming all references already pointed at `plans/archive/`.
- Confirmed `research/` had already been fully removed and no longer needed a compatibility marker.
- Kept `legacy/README.md` as the single consolidated place for old-to-new path guidance.

### Validation

- Verified the root now uses canonical folders only for active content, with no remaining redirect-only `plans/` or `research/` folders.
- Verified no remaining code or docs depend on the removed redirect folder.

---

## Review / Results — 2026-03-24 Final Polish Pass

### What changed

- Expanded `.gitignore` to cover local Python quality/test artifacts like `.ruff_cache/`, `.hypothesis/`, and coverage outputs.
- Updated `README.md` quick-start guidance to use the canonical `artifacts/`, `data/raw`, `data/interim`, and `scenarios/case_studies` paths.
- Added a dedicated Saigon18 workflow section to `README.md` so the current case-study process is discoverable from the repo entry point.
- Standardized the default example output filename in `scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl` to `commercial-rooftop_reopt-results.json` for better naming consistency.

### Validation

- Verified README examples point only at current canonical paths.
- Verified the final root structure remains clean after the polish updates.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| PV production profile | Inject from Excel (Option B) | Apples-to-apples vs Excel; avoids NREL API dependency |
| BESS degradation | `battery_replacement_year=10`, `replace_cost_per_kwh=100` | REopt uses discrete replacement model |
| CIT tax rate | Blended 0.0575 | 4yr exempt + 9yr 50% + 7yr full |
| BESS dispatch | REopt free optimization (Phase 1–2) | Uncover dispatch value vs Excel fixed schedule |
| Currency | VND→USD at 26,400 VND/USD | REopt outputs USD |
| Customer type | `"industrial"` / `high_voltage_above_35kv_below_220kv` (110kV) | Manufacturing park, 110kV grid connection |

## Scenario Summary

| ID | Description | Tariff | Sizing | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Baseline — REopt TOU optimization | Full EVN TOU (Decision 14) | Fixed (40.36 MWp + 66 MWh) | ✅ OPTIMAL |
| B | Bundled PPA — 15% discount | EVN TOU × 0.85 | Fixed | ✅ OPTIMAL |
| C | Optimized sizing | Full EVN TOU | Unconstrained (up to 60 MWp / 100 MWh) | ✅ OPTIMAL |
| D | DPPA strike price contract | EVN TOU (base) + FMP post-processing | Fixed | ⏳ Phase 3 |

## Review / Results — 2026-03-26 Phase 3 Completion + Final HTML Report

### What changed

- Rewrote `scripts/python/reopt/dppa_settlement.py` to use the actual REopt result schema (`PV.electric_to_load_series_kw` + `ElectricStorage.storage_to_load_series_kw`) and to normalize the extracted FMP series safely before computing Scenario D settlement revenue.
- Extended `scripts/python/reopt/equity_irr.py` so Scenario D can add DPPA settlement cash flows on top of the base REopt EBITDA and emit a dedicated Scenario D equity summary.
- Replaced `scripts/python/reopt/compare_reopt_vs_excel.py` with a version that supports tariff-period BESS disaggregation, Scenario D settlement/equity adders, and refreshed A/C/D markdown comparison artifacts.
- Added `tests/python/integration/test_saigon18_phase3.py` for the Scenario D schema, tariff-period BESS split, and DPPA finance-adder regression path.
- Updated `tests/run_all_tests.ps1` so the Saigon18 Phase 3 regression test runs in the Layer 4 path during full validation.
- Fixed `scripts/julia/run_vietnam_scenario.jl` output path detection so Saigon18 scenario solves write to the canonical `artifacts/results/saigon18/` tree even when invoked from bash on Windows.
- Added `scripts/python/integration/generate_html_report.py` and generated the final consolidated HTML report at `artifacts/reports/saigon18/2026-03-26_saigon18-full-analysis.html`.

### Scenario D final outputs

- Canonical solve result: `artifacts/results/saigon18/2026-03-20_scenario-d_dppa-baseline_reopt-results.json`
- DPPA settlement artifact: `artifacts/reports/saigon18/2026-03-26_scenario-d_dppa-settlement.json`
- Scenario D equity artifact: `artifacts/reports/saigon18/2026-03-26_scenario-d_equity-irr_summary.json`
- Scenario D comparison report: `artifacts/reports/saigon18/2026-03-26_scenario-d_vs_excel_comparison.md`
- Final consolidated HTML report: `artifacts/reports/saigon18/2026-03-26_saigon18-full-analysis.html`

### Key results locked for the final report

- Scenario D contract assumption used in the final report: `grid_connected`
- Scenario D strike price: `1,800 VND/kWh`
- Scenario D year-1 DPPA settlement: `$1.10M`
- Scenario D settlement NPV adder: `$15.80M`
- Scenario D total unlevered NPV (base REopt + settlement adder): `$26.35M`
- Scenario D equity IRR: `25.4%`
- Scenario A tariff-period BESS discharge: `17,543 MWh peak`, `413 MWh standard`, `0 MWh off-peak`

### Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/python/integration/test_saigon18_compare.py tests/python/integration/test_saigon18_phase3.py -v --tb=short` — PASS

### Remaining note

- Full Layer 4 rerun through `tests/run_all_tests.ps1 -Layer 4` started successfully and entered the long Julia integration section, but the CLI command timed out before completion in this session; the pre-existing Python API payload failures documented in `docs/testing.md` still apply to the repo-wide Layer 4 scope.

## Phase 20 - Ninhsim 60% Solar + Storage DPPA Implementation - 2026-04-08

- [ ] Phase 1 - Extend the Ninhsim scenario builder for a solar-plus-storage-only case with a 60% annual renewable-delivered target and the agreed export treatment
- [ ] Phase 2 - Add failing regression coverage for the tariff peg, 60% coverage logic, and the solar-plus-storage PySAM bridge
- [ ] Phase 3 - Implement the Ninhsim 60% analysis workflow, including the pegged strike, merchant-sale proxy, and combined decision artifact
- [ ] Phase 4 - Run the new REopt and PySAM case-study workflow and persist canonical JSON artifacts
- [ ] Phase 5 - Generate the synchronized HTML phase report in the repo report-skill style
- [ ] Review / Results - Record delivered files, validation commands, achieved coverage, and finance-screen outcome

### Notes

- This phase implements `plans/active/ninhsim_60pct_solar_storage_dppa_plan.md` using the defaults already agreed in the plan: annual delivered-energy target, minimum 60% threshold, solar plus storage only, solar-only battery charging, weighted-EVN tariff peg at 95%, EVN-style escalation after year one, merchant treatment for excess energy, and repo-default Vietnam finance assumptions.
- The safest first implementation path is to use REopt's renewable-electricity minimum-fraction input if the local solver accepts it, then report the achieved delivered-energy coverage directly from the solved hourly series and carry the solved case into PySAM with explicit matched-versus-merchant revenue metadata.

### Outputs Expected

- `scenarios/case_studies/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct.json`
- `artifacts/results/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct_reopt-results.json`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct_analysis.json`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct_single-owner.json`
- `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct_combined-decision.json`
- `reports/2026-04-08-ninhsim-solar-storage-60pct-dppa.html`

### Review / Results

- Implemented the Ninhsim 60% solar-plus-storage workflow across `scripts/python/integration/build_ninhsim_reopt_input.py`, `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/ninhsim_solar_storage_60pct.py`, `src/python/reopt_pysam_vn/integration/bridge.py`, and the new runner/report scripts so the case now has a reproducible REopt -> analysis -> PySAM -> combined-decision path.
- Added a dedicated Scenario C at `scenarios/case_studies/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct.json` with wind removed, solar-only battery charging preserved, larger PV/BESS search bounds, and the site-level renewable-electricity minimum fraction set to the delivered-energy target requested in the plan.
- The end-to-end solve landed `optimal` and achieved the requested delivered-energy target: `PV 100.0 MW`, `BESS 27.5637 MW / 166.7641 MWh`, annual renewable delivered to load `110.627 GWh`, exported renewable `18.291 GWh`, and delivered-energy coverage `60.03%` against annual load `184.286 GWh`.
- The fixed year-one DPPA strike was locked at `1917.93 VND/kWh` (`0.072649 USD/kWh`), which is exactly `95%` of the recomputed weighted EVN benchmark `2018.88 VND/kWh`; the merchant proxy stayed tied to the repo wholesale benchmark at `671 VND/kWh` in year one.
- The paired PySAM Single Owner finance screen published to `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct_single-owner.json` remains non-viable at the default hurdle: after-tax NPV about `-$158.59M`, after-tax IRR `null`, minimum DSCR about `-0.489`, and year-one total revenue about `$8.45M` under the blended realized price feed.
- The combined decision artifact at `artifacts/reports/ninhsim/2026-04-08_ninhsim_solar-storage_60pct_combined-decision.json` therefore marks the case as operationally feasible but not financeable at the default `15%` project-IRR target, with recommended position `needs_reprice_or_scope_change`.

## Phase 21 - DPPA Case 1 Planning Note - 2026-04-09

- [x] Phase 1 - Review the current Ninhsim REopt, export-treatment, and PySAM workflow surfaces relevant to a new no-excess solar-plus-storage case
- [x] Phase 2 - Draft a standalone markdown plan for `DPPA Case 1` that reuses the Ninhsim load profile and embeds open questions for user review
- [x] Review / Results - Save the planning artifact under `plans/active/` and record the recommended two-engine modeling split

### Notes

- This phase is planning-only and should not implement the new scenario yet.
- The requested workflow intentionally changes the engine split from the latest Ninhsim 60% run: REopt should anchor the initial optimal sizing search, while PySAM should run a fuller solar-plus-battery configuration rather than only a finance-only custom-generation bridge.
- The plan should preserve the Ninhsim `8760` load basis, enforce a `2-hour` BESS duration assumption at the REopt stage, and treat zero-excess or effectively no-export operation as a first-class design requirement rather than a post-processing preference.

### Outputs Generated

- `plans/active/dppa_case_1_plan.md`

### Review / Results

- Drafted a dedicated planning artifact for `DPPA Case 1` that uses the Ninhsim load profile, asks REopt for an initial customer-anchored PV+BESS size with fixed `2-hour` storage duration and no-excess intent, then hands the candidate design into a fuller PySAM solar-plus-battery workflow for plant, battery, and finance refinement.
- Embedded all material open questions directly in the plan, including the exact no-excess interpretation, whether REopt may undersize slightly to avoid export, whether grid charging is allowed, what commercial settlement applies if trace exports remain, and which metric should define the final recommended design after the REopt-to-PySAM handoff.

---

## Phase 22 - DPPA Case 1 Implementation - 2026-04-09

- [x] Phase 1 - Research and freeze the private-wire DPPA and fuller PySAM module path for PV plus 2-hour BESS
- [x] Phase 2 - Add failing regression coverage for the new REopt sizing logic, no-excess handling, and fuller PySAM bridge expectations
- [x] Phase 3 - Build the `DPPA Case 1` REopt scenario, analysis helpers, and machine-readable REopt summary artifacts
- [x] Phase 4 - Implement the fuller PySAM PV+BESS workflow with solar-only charging and private-wire revenue treatment
- [x] Phase 5 - Run the end-to-end REopt -> PySAM workflow, compare both engines, and persist canonical artifacts
- [x] Phase 6 - Generate a report artifact after each implementation phase and publish a more extensive final report at the end
- [x] Review / Results - Record delivered files, validations, report paths, and the final recommended position

### Notes

- This phase implements `plans/active/dppa_case_1_plan.md` using the defaults now agreed in the plan: near-zero export target with negligible spill tolerated, exact `2-hour` BESS duration, REopt objective anchored on minimum project capex, solar-only battery charging, private-wire DPPA logic, and project plus equity IRR as the main decision metrics.
- The phase should keep the strongest role split between the tools: REopt for first-pass sizing under tariff and load constraints, and PySAM for fuller PV-plus-battery behavior plus finance.
- A report should be generated at each major phase checkpoint, and the end-of-phase report should be more extensive than the interim checkpoints.

### Interim Notes

- Researched the fuller PySAM path and froze `PVWatts + Battwatts + Utilityrate5 + Singleowner` as the stable workstation-supported implementation for this case after the more detailed `Pvsamv1` route proved unreliable locally.
- Added failing regression coverage in `tests/python/integration/test_dppa_case_1.py` and `tests/python/pysam/test_dppa_case_1_pvwatts.py`, then implemented the first REopt-side scenario builder, comparison helpers, and the new fuller PySAM bridge/runtime modules.

- `scripts/python/integration/generate_ninhsim_dppa_case_1_report.py`
- Thin wrappers under `scripts/python/` for the new DPPA Case 1 entrypoints

### Review / Results

- Implemented the new DPPA Case 1 workflow surface end to end: REopt scenario build, REopt summary analysis, fuller PySAM PVWatts+battery runner, comparison artifact, combined decision artifact, and final HTML report.
- Added the requested interim HTML review surfaces at `reports/2026-04-09-dppa-case-1-phase-a.html`, `reports/2026-04-09-dppa-case-1-phase-b.html`, and `reports/2026-04-09-dppa-case-1-phase-c.html`, using the same report-template structure as the other phased repo deliverables.
- Fixed the new PySAM input-builder lane so unit-test input construction no longer requires a real weather file until execution time, and added a canonical zero-battery placeholder artifact so the full workflow remains machine-readable even when the REopt solve does not select storage.
- Ran the full DPPA Case 1 workflow successfully and generated the canonical artifacts listed above; the current solved case uses `38.108 MW` PV, `0 MW / 0 MWh` BESS, `0.000%` export fraction, about `2.055 GWh` curtailment, and REopt NPV about `$11.17M`.
- Under the user-selected minimum-capex objective plus near-zero-export intent, REopt chose zero battery, so the private-wire strike falls back to the `solar_ground_no_storage` south ceiling at `1012.00 VND/kWh` and the fuller PySAM battery run is intentionally marked `skipped` rather than failing.
- The current final recommendation is `needs_reprice_or_resize` because the design passes the export screen but fails the exact `2-hour` battery requirement in practice and therefore cannot clear the project/equity IRR screen through the fuller battery workflow without tightening the storage requirement or changing the objective.
